						<h3>Latest coronavirus news as of 5 pm on 15 May</h3>
						<h4><strong>UK’s estimated coronavirus infection rate is now between 0.7 and 1</strong></h4>
						<p>The UK’s coronavirus R value – the estimated number of people each person infects – is now between 0.7 and 1, according to the government’s scientific advisory group for emergencies (SAGE). Five days ago, UK prime minister Boris Johnson said R was between 0.5 and 0.9. The government’s science advisors say the increase is not a reflection of coronavirus restrictions being eased in England this week, but rather due to a lag in the data that is used to model the R value. We won’t know how easing restrictions has impacted the current R value for another three weeks.</p>
						
						<h4><strong>Other coronavirus developments</strong></h4>
						
						<p>Only 1500 of a total of 18,000 coronavirus contact tracers – just over 8 per cent – have been recruited by the UK government by its mid-May deadline, a cabinet minister said today. The government had previously refused to say exactly how many contact tracers it had employed.</p>
						
						<p>Up to 8 million people could be on waiting lists for National Health Service (NHS) treatment by autumn, UK ministers heard yesterday. Hospital capacity could be cut by 30 per cent as trusts attempt to implement social distancing among staff and patients.</p>

						<p>16 health unions have asked the UK government to provide rapid testing and adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) for doctors and nurses before the NHS reopens services that were cancelled during the covid-19 peak. This comes as evidence has emerged suggesting some doctors were pressured by NHS managers not to share their concerns about PPE.</p>

						<p>US citizens should prepare to face the “darkest winter in modern history,” according to a whistleblower who was recently removed from his position as a government public health official. Rick Bright, who was ousted from his role leading a federal agency in charge of vaccine development in April, told a US congressional committee that the “window is closing to address this pandemic” and criticised the Trump administration’s lack of planning.</p>

						<p>There have been no new covid-19 deaths announced in China for a month and only 91 patients are currently receiving treatment for the disease. 623 people are in isolation for suspected or confirmed coronavirus.</p>

						<p>The first coronavirus cases have been detected in Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh. The densely populated camps are home to more than 1 million people, with an estimated 60,000 to 90,000 people per square kilometre living in small shelters.</p>
						<p>Germany’s economy shrank by 2.2 per cent in the first quarter of this year, according to data released by the country’s federal statistics authority, the biggest contraction since the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

						<p>Slovenia has become the first country in Europe to declare its coronavirus epidemic over, after daily new confirmed cases remained below seven for the last two weeks.</p>

						<p>Restrictions to limit the spread of coronavirus were eased today in New South Wales, Australia, with pubs and clubs reopening.</p>

						<p>Large areas of London will become car-free zones to facilitate social distancing by cyclists and pedestrians as coronavirus restrictions are eased, mayor Sadiq Khan has announced.</p>
